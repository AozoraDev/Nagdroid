## Nagdroid - For ethical and conscientious Android crackers
Nagdroid is an add-on nagware for those Android app pirates who still have sympathy for the app developers. \
It functions similarly to nagware in WinRAR, displaying a pop-up every time the app is opened after 30 days, with the hope that the user feels annoyed and eventually intends to purchase the app.
